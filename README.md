Python code to create IPCC AR6 Figure 7.10 -- a "violin plot" showing the distribution of CMIP5, CMIP6, and AR6 expert-assessed radiative feedbacks. The provided json file contains feedbacks from all available CMIP5 and CMIP6 models that performed the abrupt-4xCO2 experiments and archived enough data to perform radiative kernel calculations. These feedbacks are computed as in [Zelinka et al. (2020)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL085782), and are averaged over 6 radiative kernels. (This is slightly different from Zelinka et al. [2020], which primarily reported results from a single kernel.) The figure that this code generates is also provided.
